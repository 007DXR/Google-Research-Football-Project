# Google-Research-Football-Project

Google Research Football(GF) is a novel Reinforcement-Learning environment based on open-source game called Gameplay. Google Research creates GF for training their RL models and other more profound research purposes.

Making use of the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning methods, my teammate and I carried out some experiments on GF Project.
We implemented algorithms such as DQN, D3QN, PPO and tested their effects on three different Google Football environments. We chose appropriate parameter settings according to both empirical and theoretical reasons. 

We trained the neural network for several weeks. Finally we got an outstanding result that the agent performs well with the well-designed parameter settings.
